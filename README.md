# CompSciMageeClassWork
The work I've done on assignments and class questions.

Each week is organised into folders, then each question is usually in a single class file, mostly Java.
I may have duplicate files written in different languages as practice.


# My languages are:
C#

Java

JavaScript

Python

# UULib

Some projects use UULib as an import, a library written by our lecturer (Aiden McCaughey) \n
