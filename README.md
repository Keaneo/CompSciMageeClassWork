# CompSciMageeClassWork
The work I've done on assignments and class questions.

Each week is organised into folders, then each question is usually in a single class file, mostly Java.
I may have duplicate files written in different languages as practice.


# My languages are:
C#

Java

JavaScript

Python

# UULib

It handles input for Java, providing easy access to methods such as getInt(), getString() and more.  
This is easier than using things like Scanner for handling simple input, removes the reason to have to think about its intricacies when writing simple programs.
